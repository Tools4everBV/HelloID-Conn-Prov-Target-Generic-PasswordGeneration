# HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-Generic-PasswordGeneration
Powershell target system to generate random password to be used across multiple target systems. Unforunately currently it stores it as visible field in the Account Information tab. Currently you cannot store it as a hidden field. This implementation should only be used for a initial password and user's should be required to change their password in each target system.
